# ArÏ‡iv Weekly Summaries
This creates a weekly summary of filtered content on the arxiv using the excellent [arxiv api](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/index.html) and [this Python wrapper](https://github.com/titipata/arxivpy).
The summary is in the form of a markdown document compiled to html.

## Recommended Usage
1) Downlaod this repository.
2) Create a Python virtual environment in this directory and install the dependencies.
  - `cd location/of/this/repository/`
  - `python3 -m venv env`
  - `source env/bin/activate`
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - `deactivate`
3) Edit the filter file using the format described below.
5) Edit the location of the filter file by editing `filter_file_location` in `main.py`.
4) Edit where you want the weekly summaries to be stored by editing `save_dir` in `main.py`.
5) Using your virtual environment, run `main.py`.
  - `location/of/this/repository/env/bin/python3 location/of/this/repository/src/main.py`

## Filter file format
The filter file has a simple format described below.
```
# Comment lines that are ignored
REPOSITORIES:
math.gr
math.at

AUTHORS:
Jon McCammond
Ruth Charney
# Hyphens and potentially other symbols should be substituted for underscores.
Rose Morris_Wright

KEYWORDS:
artin
coxter
braid group
maths is cool
```
The filtering works as follows:
- Only papers submitted to (or cross posted to) at least one of the listed repositories will be included.
- If a paper is authored (or co-authored) by at least one of the listed authors, it will be included.
- If a paper contains at least one of the keywords (which can also be key phrases) in the title or abstract, it will be included.
- A paper does not need to match authors and keywords to be included. If it just matches an author, or just matches a keyword, it will be included.
- Capitalisation and diacritics are ignored (as far as I can tell).
